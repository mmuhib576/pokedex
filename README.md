Pokemon Application Project with Java

In this project, we created a mobile application called “Pokedex”, which is a simple application that displays the list of Pokemons.
The product was a simple implementation to help further understand the tools, technologies, and techniques to build scalable and testable Android applications.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate all the skills which we have experienced by covering the course. The project was built using some of the recommended practices by Google, which are outlined as follows:
●	MVVM architecture
●	Android Jetpack Component
●	Offline caching using Room Persistence Library
●	Working with web services and the overall networking using Retrofit and Okhttp.
It consists of a single application screen that handles the display of the different pokemon names and images.
The application has a search feature that allows users to search for their favourite pokemon on the app.
